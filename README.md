My name is Arthur and I am currently working as a developer at budgetbox. I have 3 years of experience in the software field and am well-versed in platform automation and problem solving in general. 

I am excited to be a part of this community and look forward to contributing to the open-source's success.

Take a look at my production, you might find what you need.
